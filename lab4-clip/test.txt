# --- COMMANDS TO RUN EVALUATION ---

# Note on Dataset Paths:
# The scripts assume the COCO 2014 dataset is located at "../coco2014".
# Please modify the 'BASE_ROOT' variable in 'dataset.py' and 'dataset_augmentation.py'
# if your dataset is located elsewhere.

# Note on Checkpoints:
# Ensure 'checkpoints/' or 'checkpoints_augmentation/' directories exist 
# and contain 'clip_epoch_5.pt' before running.

# 1. Run Baseline Evaluation (Calculates Recall@K and generates visualizations)
python eval.py

# 2. Run Augmented Evaluation (Calculates Recall@K and generates visualizations)
# python eval_augmentation.py
